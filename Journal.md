# Day 1

Bit confused today, not able to understand what exactly I should do. The days are passing and I am not able to do things properly.

So I started this challenge again.

## Learning from the last challenge:

1. Start saying NO. Say No to people, say no to not wanting to learn, say no to comfort zone.
2. There can be day where you are not feeling to work but that day also you have to show up. No other option.
3. You have less time so priritize things and work on them.

Today I will be starting the backend again.

There is huge gap in my coding so I have to revisit and make some of the things again.
I will plan things tonight, as of now I am start backend
